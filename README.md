## My process

This is particular was a hard project for me because this is the first project on which I wanted to use React (which I'm still learning), the hardest part was on think how I was going to structure the project and see which components I was going to make that will be re-usable in the future. Although this is far from perfect I think I did a pretty good job as my first project, still I have a lot to learn of React but I'm happy I'm progressing.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Implementing react and working with components. Also I had to learn about React Router to be able to display different URL depending on the planet (to make the feel of loading new pages), I learned a lot of things over the course of the project because I came across with problems with props, states, etc.

For CSS, since this project have a particular layout I thought that CSS Grid was a good way to achieve what's been asked so I had to learned it! Still far from expert using CSS Grid but now I had a based.

### Continued development

I'm far from becoming an Expert on React but I think I can now defend myself. Still need to learn to have a better view at strcturing projects and a LOT of features as well but I think this will come with practice which I will continue to do.
